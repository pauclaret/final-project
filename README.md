# Happiness Around the World: A Tableau Visualization Project ðŸŒŽ

This project aims to explore the data related to happiness in different countries of the world, as well as other metrics like GDP per capita, exercise, weather, and more. Tableau was used to create interactive visualizations that allow users to analyze and explore the data in depth. The visualizations in this project are available at this Tableau Public link ðŸ¤—.

# Data ðŸ”¢
The data folder contains various datasets:

- World Happiness Report 2021: This dataset contains information about happiness scores and rankings, as well as factors that contribute to happiness, for 149 countries.
- World Development Indicators: This dataset contains information about economic and social indicators for countries around the world, such as GDP per capita, population, and life expectancy.
- Weather Data: This dataset contains information about weather conditions in various cities around the world, such as temperature, precipitation, and humidity.
- Exercise Data: This dataset contains information about physical exercise levels in different countries, such as the percentage of adults who meet the recommended levels of physical activity.

All datasets were cleaned and preprocessed using Python before being used in Tableau.

# Visualizations ðŸ“Š
The following visualizations were created using Tableau:

- Happiness Score by Country: This map shows the happiness score of each country in the dataset, allowing users to explore how happiness is distributed around the world and compare happiness levels between countries.
- Happiness Rank by Region: This bar chart shows the average happiness rank of countries by region, allowing users to explore which regions of the world have the highest and lowest happiness levels.
- Happiness Score vs. GDP per Capita: This scatter plot shows the relationship between a country's happiness score and its GDP per capita, allowing users to explore whether there is a correlation between wealth and happiness.
- Happiness Score vs. Exercise Levels: This scatter plot shows the relationship between a country's happiness score and its level of physical exercise, allowing users to explore whether there is a correlation between exercise and happiness.
- Weather Conditions by Region: This map shows the average temperature and precipitation levels for different regions of the world, allowing users to explore how weather conditions vary around the world.
- Happiness Score and GDP per Capita by Region: This scatter plot shows the relationship between a region's average happiness score and average GDP per capita, allowing users to explore how wealth and happiness are distributed by region.
- Happiness Score and Exercise Levels by Region: This scatter plot shows the relationship between a region's average happiness score and average level of physical exercise, allowing users to explore how exercise and happiness are distributed by region.

# Conclusion ðŸŒŸ
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of happiness levels and related factors around the world. By visualizing the data in an interactive dashboard, users can gain insights into how happiness is distributed around the world and how it relates to other factors such as wealth, exercise, and weather.
